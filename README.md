# Recipe Traffic Prediction Project

## Project Overview
This project aims to improve recipe selection for a website's homepage by leveraging machine learning to predict and display the most popular recipes, ultimately increasing website traffic and user engagement.

## Problem Statement
Traditional recipe selection methods based on personal preference have led to inconsistent results and suboptimal user experience. Our goal is to develop a data-driven approach to recipe recommendation that can:
- Objectively identify high-traffic recipes
- Provide insights into recipe characteristics that drive user engagement
- Create a scalable, repeatable method for homepage content curation

## Project Motivation
In the competitive digital content landscape, understanding user preferences is crucial. This project addresses key challenges:
- Subjective recipe selection leads to unpredictable user engagement
- Manual curation is time-consuming and potentially biased
- Lack of data-driven insights limits content strategy effectiveness

## Project Setup and Environment Configuration

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- pip or conda package manager
- Git for version control

  - Developed nuanced feature representations

### Machine Learning Approach

#### Model Selection Rationale
We explored multiple machine learning approaches to predict recipe traffic:

1. **Logistic Regression**
   - *Pros:* 
     - Interpretable model
     - Provides feature importance
     - Works well with binary classification
   - *Limitations:* 
     - Assumes linear relationships
     - May oversimplify complex interactions

2. **Random Forest Classifier**
   - *Pros:*
     - Handles non-linear relationships
     - Provides feature importance
     - Robust to overfitting
   - *Chosen Approach:* 
     - Offers a balance between interpretability and predictive power
     - Captures complex interactions between recipe features

#### Model Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
- ROC-AUC Curve

### Key Insights and Findings
- Identified critical features driving recipe traffic
- Developed a reproducible method for recipe selection
- Demonstrated the power of data-driven content curation

## Advanced Analysis Techniques
